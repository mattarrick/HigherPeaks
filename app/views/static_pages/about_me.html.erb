        <!-- <h6>Since age 19, Iâ€™ve worked in a wide variety of jobs in the social services field. My entire career, people
            from all walks of life have helped me become the therapist I am today. The teens I worked with in
            juvenile treatment facilities and in the community taught me that compassion and patience can create a
            brighter future for the next generations. Assisting individuals with different abilities showed me that we
            are all capable of reaching our truest potential if we have someone believe in us. And I have learned that
            by understanding why individuals engage in unhealthy behaviors, often landing them in the criminal
            system, empathy can help those individuals heal and create a safer place for our community.</h6> -->
